Problems with REV 0.1

C1 is a throughole, and ... should probably be surface mount (Fixed)
Ethernet was completely wrong. (Fixed)

The pinout for the DAC and ADC is totally wrong (maybe fixed)

Needs alternative regulators since the parts specd are chip-shortage
unobtainable right now.  (-2.5V and 2.5V regulators and REF2020)

The combined 10 pin plug probably has to be 12, and needs the REF2020
Check everywhere to make sure 3.3V and REF is right
